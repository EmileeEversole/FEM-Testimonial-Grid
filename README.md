## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

I've worked with CSS grid in the past, but never to this extent. It certainly took some trial and error, but I definitely feel like I've gotten a better understanding of the concepts. 

### Continued development

I like the possibilities of using grid, so I think I'll start looking for more challenges that use it/find ways to incorporate it into other projects, so I can get some more practice in.
